# EtnaStud

The alternative face of the intranet.

_Built with Django and a lot of love_ 


## Goal

The aim of this project is to be able to use the APIs from school without being
bothered by the current UI. (no offense)

In order to do this, the plateform will fetch informations from the available
APIs, transform them, and create Models used in the Django Admin Panel.

This will allow us to view grades per projet, rankings, and even interact
with the APIs. (tickets, messages, ...)


## Installation

Currently, the installation is the following:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
